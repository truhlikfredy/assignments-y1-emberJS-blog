# Eclipse import
**play eclipsify** needs to be run to import into eclipse with all paths setup properly.

# Running the application
In command line this command needs to be executed:

**play run**

If this gives a error, probably the play framework is not installed.

Website will be aviable on **http://localhost:9000/**
